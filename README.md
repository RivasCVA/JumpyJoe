# Jumpy Joe
A Java programming class's End-Of-The-Year project. Developed through the [Greenfoot IDE](https://www.greenfoot.org/home). A platformer game where the player has to collect all coins and reach the flag to advance to the next level. At the same time, the player has to avoid enemies that shoot back when the player is in close proximity.
